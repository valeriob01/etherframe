<p>Etherframe is a simple ethernet frame receiver with bare protocol decoding and frame statistics. The intended use is to try capture of signal quality. Multiple factors generally concur to signal quality.</p>
<p>Etherframe currently builds and run on Fedora.</p>
<p>Starting from version 0.1.4, Etherframe includes a prototype support for COP and ROP system control variables introduced in the <A href="http://www.selnet.org/pubs/PMM.html">Preventive Maintenance Model</A>, so that we can produce <em>surveyed data</em> and actually <u>measure</u> experiments. In the network case, the COP is <u>computed</u> directly from the <em>surveyed data</em> given on input by the network interface card.</p>

<h2>Lab Test</h2>
<p>The accuracy of ROP has been improved to six digits, so that smaller variations can be seen. The minimum required accuracy is expected to vary, depending on cable type and test conditions. The ROP check can be tested with various test engines.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<h3>Definition of accuracy</h3>
<p><em>The degree of conformity with a standard, or a value accepted as correct or true. For measured operational data the accuracy is normally expressed in terms of a quantity of a stated resolution within which there is a defined confidence of the true resolution falling.</em></p>

<h3>Definition of precision</h3>
<p><em>A measure of the tendency of a set of random numbers to cluster about a number determined by the set. Usual measure: Standard deviation with respect to the average or its reciprocal.</em></p>

<h3>Definition of resolution</h3>
<p><em>The smallest difference between two adjacent values which can be represented in a measuring system. The number of decimal points or the scale of units to which a measured or computed data item can be recorded, displayed or transferred.</em></p>

<h3>Quality of data</h3>
<p>The terms 'precision' and 'resolution' are often interchangeable in general use. Here they stand for a measure of the data field capacities that are available within a specific system (example: 54&#186; 33' 15" is expressed to a resolution of one second). Any process that manipulates data subsequent to the original measurement or definition cannot increase the precision to which the data were originally measured or defined, regardless of the resolution available within the system itself.</p>
