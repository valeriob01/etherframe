Synopsis:
---------
Etherframe is a simple ethernet frame receiver with bare up-level
protocol decoding and cable statistics. The intended use is to measure
EMI, noise, and signal attenuation in ethernet cables placed in an
environment disturbed by magnetic fields.
The typical monitored cables are Cat.3-4-5 or higher Cat.:
- Unshielded Twisted Pair cables (UTP)
- Shielded Twisted Pair cables (STP)
- Foiled Twisted Pair cables (FTP)
- Digital Subscriber Loop

and also obsolete coaxial cables:
- Thick Ethernet
- Thin Ethernet (RG58-50Ohm cable)

Unshielded network cables or shielded cables approaching 
the maximum ethernet cable length, *will* be affected
when exposed to powerful magnetic fields.
A test setup is being constructed at the laboratory
to inject noise along a long ethernet cable.

Long DSL cables are especially affected.

Platforms:
----------
Etherframe currently compile and run on Debian.

Usage:
------
Since Etherframe opens a socket, and sets the eth0 interface in
promiscuous mode, you need to be logged in as root to run the program.
